# Nicole-s-3D-Virtual-Tours
This was my first professional project. I designed and built the site from scratch. This website was an amazing learning experience for me. I ran into many challenges such as making the iframes responsive and ensuring all the media was properly optimized. I created my first build process during this project to concatenate, autoprefix, and minify my source code.
