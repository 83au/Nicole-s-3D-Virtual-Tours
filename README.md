# Nicole-s-3D-Virtual-Tours
<p>This was my first professional project. I designed and built the site with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery. I created my first build process during this project to concatenate, autoprefix, and minify my source code.</p>

  The most challenging and greatest learning experience in making this website was ensuring its performance wasn't bogged down by the large number of media assets. I performed a number of optimizations to speed up the performance of the website. The images are lazyloaded and optimized, and I created webp versions of each image to serve in supported browsers. I also performed dynamic pagination to reduce scrolling and further improve loading speeds.
